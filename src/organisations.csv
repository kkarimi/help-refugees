It provides a regular space for young people who are newly arrived in the UK, most of whom are here alone without family. Contact for address.
2. Refuge in Films: The young people in RefugeeYouth run an annual film festival, hosted by the British Film Institute. The festival is not just about the passive experience of watching a film. Through creative workshops, discussion and meaningful dialogue, we engage with people on a human level, breaking down barriers and prejudice between people from different communities, backgrounds and generations.
3. Women's Circle: At our sessions, we explore issues close to our hearts, such as femininity, gender issues, roles of men and women, media portrayal of women, the feminist movement, beauty, sexualisation of women, and equality. Through activities such as drama, dance, sports, fitness and healthy eating, young women can participate in a friendly and non-judgmental way, and also gain new skills and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
4. Arts Night: weekly arts nights at our hub in Oval, London. At these creative skills-based workshops, 15-25 young people come together to explore the issues affecting them, using the arts to convey their messages to the wider public. There is a variety of projects and activities, including music production, poetry, drumming, dance, capoeira, painting, fashion and printing.",London,South London - Kennington,"54 Kennington Oval, London SE11 5SW
