# HelpRefugees

This application is used to add, update, and search for organisations which 
provide valuable services for refugees.

## To Do
- [ ] Google Maps/ geolocation
- [ ] At the moment, when a user clicks on 'self-assign', the page refreshes 
      back to the top and it's quite difficult to find the service again. Can 
      all self-assigned orgs be stuck to the top of the page?
- [ ] The '?' help section for each Question
- [x] 'Category' filter at the top.
